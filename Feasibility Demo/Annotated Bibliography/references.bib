    In this book, Levin provides in depth detail about macOS in the User Space and how it fundamentally operates. It covers useful features such as the internals of applications, the underlying architecture of macOS and private frameworks and libraries that are leveraged by Apple.The author aims to provide a go-to reference for macOS and how it provides for its users. \\
    The research that Levin provides is vital for gathering an underlying knowledge of macOS. It forms a basis for developing further knowledge of macOS and covers the fundamentals. The only limitation that it features, which is common with macOS resources, is that it is focused on an older version of macOS. The version in the book covers macOS XXX. Although the book covers an older version however, it is still incredibly useful as topics discussed in it are still relevant.

    title={*OS Internals::Kernel Mode},
    year={2019},
    publisher={Technologeeks.com},
    address={North Castle, New York},
    addendum={\\
    Levin discusses how the kernel operates in this volume of his books. It covers topics such as the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP), Kernel Extensions and and the Apple File System (APFS). By discussing the use of the kernel in macOS it allows for discovering how it is leveraged to provide features for the OS.\\
    By Levin providing these resources, it allows for interesting areas of teh macOS kernel to be investigated, for example, APFS which Apple are pushing to be used on newer versions of macOS. This is lightly documented however Levin has uncovered many areas about it and highlights key aspects of it and interesting areas to investigate. Levin also discusses the SEP, which handles secure operations of the Mac device. This can be important to dissect if malware can leverage it to perform encryption.

    title={*OS Internals::Security and Insecurity},
    year={2017},

    address={North Castle, New York},
    addendum={\\
    The second book published in the series by Levin focuses on the security, and lack thereof at times, of macOS. This volume covers the security fundamentals of macOS including Sandboxing, Code Signing and Authentication. It also discovers past exploits that have been found in the wild are reverse engineers them to discuss the techniques employed by the developers of said malware. This book aims to provide an in-depth discussion of how macOS protects its users and how malware has successfully bypassed these protections.\\
    By producing this book, Levin has provided a valuable resource for detailing macOS security. It focuses on macOS 10.13, however an appendix has been made available discussing changes in macOS 10.14, of which there were many. With Levin discussing common exploit techniques, it proves incredibly important although it uses historic samples. The points provided when covering these samples still provide an underlying look at how modern malware exploits macOS.

@book{IncidentResponse,
	author={Kevin Mandia and Matthew Pepe and Jason Luttgens},
	year={2014},
	month={Aug 1,},
	title={Incident response \& computer forensics},
	publisher={McGraw-Hill},
	edition={3},
	address={USA},
	addendum={\\
	The authors have written an in-depth guide for Incident Response, primarily on Windows, however cover macOS to an extent. The book features common techniques for Incident Response and provide fundamentals to be built upon. Although the book mainly focuses on Windows, the techniques presented can also be applied to macOS. \\
	The book also presents basic malware triage and persistence techniques which are important for incident response. These techniques can be employed in the end tool that is developed and will be used to develop my knowledge further for incident response. The only downside to this book is due to the age of it. It is very common with Incident Response publications that they are outdated very quickly, however the underlying knowledge provided can still be used.

	month={May 7,},
	title={OS X Incident Response},
	publisher={Syngress Media Incorporated},
	address={Cambridge, Massachusetts},
	addendum={\\
	Bradley has written a detailed guide of the Incident Response process focused solely on macOS. Presenting a brief overview of macOS internals and then focusing on the important files to retrieve, why to retrieve them and finally how to. The books discusses topics such as memory analysis, common privilege escalation techniques and exfiltration from a target device. \\
	The techniques and advice presented by Bradley is the only resource that focuses solely on macOS and Incident Response. Due to this, the topics discussed are incredibly useful and relevant to the topic at hand. The version covered is macOS 10.9, however from current testing it mostly still applies, however some suggested file locations or commands need to be altered slightly.\\
	Ultimately, Bradley has provided a vital publication that will form the basis of the research, with other sources building on that.

	addendum={\\
	Oakley operates a blog which focuses on macOS, amidst other topics. The research that is performed is typically related to issues that can occur with macOS and also guides on undocumented or hard to find features. \\
	The majority of research that Oakley presents proves to be useful, for example a post was written detailing checking signatures of Applications. Alongside these, Oakley also keeps track of XProtect and MRT updates, which can be difficult to discover as Apple do not publish when they perform these updates. \\
	In general, Oakley presents multiple different topics that can prove useful, and will certainly be used to maintain a record of XProtect and MRT updates.

@online{objsee,
	author={Patrick Wardle},
	title={Objective-See},
	url={https://objective-see.com/index.html},
	year={2019},
	addendum={\\
	Objective-See is a well-known source of information in the macOS research community. Wardle, the author for the website, has presented many talks at conferences and is a macOS malware researcher. The blog posts that are provided by him are incredibly useful for the malware detection aspect, and he has also written some posts that implement undocumented API's from Apple to, for example, develop a process and file monitor. Wardle has also written multiple posts mainly on reverse engineering malware for macOS and details how they operate and gain persistence. These facts are important for Incident Response as it is required to attempt to find where the malware persists from.\\
	The research that Wardle produces is incredibly well developed and relied upon heavily by many people who perform research into macOS. The malware samples that are going to be used within this project are going to be retrieved from this source as they are reliable and recommended by other macOS researchers.
